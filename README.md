# Assignment 4.1 – Mood Detection with OpenCV

**Happy? Sad? Angry? Confused?**  
Whatever you're feeling, this project is built to read it — right from your face. Welcome to **Mood Detection with OpenCV**, where we blend computer vision and emotions in one simple and powerful application.

---

## 🎯 Objective

This assignment aims to introduce you to **computer vision** by building a facial expression recognition system that can:

- ✅ Detect if the face belongs to **you** or someone else  
- ✅ Recognize and classify **your mood** — limited to:
  - 😄 Happy  
  - 😢 Sad  
  - 😠 Angry  
  - 😕 Confused  
- ✅ Perform testing to evaluate the system’s performance

## 🧠 What is Mood Detection?

**Mood detection** is the process of identifying a person’s emotional state through cues like facial expressions. Using OpenCV, we analyze facial features to detect subtle differences in expression and classify them into emotional states.

This type of system can be the foundation for real-world applications like:

- Emotion-aware virtual assistants  
- Mental health monitoring tools  
- Interactive gaming or storytelling experiences

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- 🐍 Python  
- 👁️ OpenCV (for face detection and feature extraction)  
---

## 🧪 Testing & Evaluation

To test and evaluate your system:

- 📷 Run it on both your own face and others  
- 😬 Check how accurately each mood is detected  
- 📝 Track performance across different:
  - Lighting conditions  
  - Facial angles  
  - Facial accessories (glasses, mask, etc.)  
- ❌ Document any false positives or negatives

## 🚀 Final Notes

This is just the beginning of what facial recognition can do. By understanding expressions, we’re one step closer to building systems that can interact with us more naturally and empathetically.

So go ahead — test it, improve it, and **make it better**! 🌟
